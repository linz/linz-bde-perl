# BDE files

BDE files are pipe delimited files of data. 
The data in each file is preceded by header text defining the nature of
the extract and the table and fields in the data.

More info on the format can be found in the
[landonline bde overview](landonline-bde-overview.pdf)
document.

# History

BDE files were once available as a public format for accessing
[Landonline](http://www.linz.govt.nz/land/landonline) data, but has been
discontinued since around 2002.

As of 2017 The BDE file format is still used internally by LINZ for
transfering data from the Landonline system to the new
[LDS](https://data.linz.govt.nz).
