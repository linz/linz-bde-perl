A BDE repository consists of a directory with sub folders `level_0` and
`level_5` containing respectively the full and incremental update files.
Each folder contains sub folders for each update, which are named according to 
the time of the update as YYYYMMDDhhmmss.  Within each folder the files for
each table are named xxx.crs.gz, where xxx is a code for the table.
